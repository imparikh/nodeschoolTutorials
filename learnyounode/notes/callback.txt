Instead, node is somewhere in the middle. It is:

Designed to be simple and therefore relatively easy to understand and use
Useful for I/O based programs that need to be fast and/or handle lots of connections
At a lower level, node can be described as a tool for writing two major types of programs:

Network programs using the protocols of the web: HTTP, TCP, UDP, DNS and SSLâˆ‘
Programs that read and write data to the filesystem or local processes/memory
What is an "I/O based program"? Here are some common I/O sources:

Databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB)
APIs (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Apple Push Notifications)
HTTP/WebSocket connections (from users of a web app)
Files (image resizer, video editor, internet radio)
